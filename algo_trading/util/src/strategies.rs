//! Defines the basis of the strategy system for the platform.  The main way of defining strategies has two parts:
//! The `Strategy` which accepts data from all parts of the platform and is in charge of managing the
//! `TradingCondition`s on the tick processor and the `TradingConditon`s themselves which are the lowest level of
//! independent control that the platform supports.  The state of each handler is only known to that handler and
//! they can only communicate events back to their parent strategy via `ContingencyAction`s.
//!
//! Strategies are not responsible for driving their own progress or requesting/querying for data from external
//! sources or tickstreams.  Instead, a strategy executor manages this externally leaving strategies only the task
//! of processing the supplied data.
//!
//! TODO: Write readme file on the whole strategy system once it's (more) finalized
