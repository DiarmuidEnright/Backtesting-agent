# Instance Spawner

This is the main entry point to the TickGrinder platform.  It is responsible for spawning and managing all instances of the platform.

By default, it spawns the MM interface, which can be used to initiate trading activity, run backtests, and perform all other bot functionality, and a Logger instance.
